# Lab - Getting Started with Kubernetes

## Exercise 1 - Interacting with Kubernetes using `kubectl`

```kubectl```, pronounced *Kube-Control*, is the  command line interface for running commands against a Kubernetes clusters. In this execise, you will explore some useful features of ```kubectl``` that you may find useful.

1. Get Cluster information.

    ```bash
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```

2. Write Cluster information to a file name 'cluster.txt'.

    ```bash
    # may need bash / git-bash if output stream '>' doesn't work 
    kubectl cluster-info > cluster.txt

    # view it using cat if you like
    cat cluster.txt
    ```

3. Get a list of all namespaces in the cluster. Here you will see other participants namespaces too. In real world, you may or may not have access to view other namespaces.

    ```bash
    kubectl get namespaces

    # or use the short-hand
    kubectl get ns

    # filter your namespace by using `grep`
    kubectl get ns | grep '<your-namespace-name>' 
    ```

4. Check your `default` namespace for your current context.

    ```bash
    kubectl config get-contexts     
    ```

    You should see an output such as below with your `your namespace name` appearing under NAMESPACE column. 

    ```bash
    # example output for above command
    CURRENT   NAME   CLUSTER   AUTHINFO               NAMESPACE
    *         cw     cw        clusterUser_cw-rg_cw   <your-namespace-name>
    ```

    > Important: If the NAMESPACE column is blank or doesn't contain your namespace name, it means you haven't configured your default namespace correctly. See repo's readme document or reach out to the instructor for help.

4. Get a list of nodes in the cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes 

    # see more info with -o wide
    kubectl get nodes -o wide

    ```

## Exercise 2 - Use `Explain` for docs

```kubectl explain``` will explain the given resource. For example, a top level API-object like Pod or a specific field like a Pod's container. 

1. Get the documentation of a Pod resource and its fields.

    ```bash
    kubectl explain node
    ```

2. Get the documentation for a Pod's container specification.

    ```bash
    # to just explain pod
    kubectl explain pod  

    # to further explain the properties and nested objects
    kubectl explain pods.spec.containers
    ```

    > **Note:** ```pods.spec.containers``` matches the yaml object structure:
    > ```yaml
    > apiVersion: v1
    > kind: Pod
    > metadata:
    > creationTimestamp: null
    > name: nginx
    > spec:
    >   containers:
    >   - image: nginx
    >     imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    >     name: nginx
    >     resources: {}
    >   dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
    >   restartPolicy: Never
    > ```

## Exercise 3 - Retrieve CPU and Memory metrics from your nodes

1. See cpu and memory usage of all nodes

    ```bash    
    kubectl top nodes    
    ```

    If you're interested to know more about metrics in k8s, take a look at:   

    * [Metrics server in k8s](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)
    
    * [Cpu units in K8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#cpu-units)

    * [Memory units in K8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#memory-units)

2. Find out `CPU` and `memory` limits on the first node in cluster

    The resource limits you see here were created by existing workloads such as dashboard, metrics-server, etc

    ```bash    
    # get list of nodes
    kubectl get nodes     
    # describe a particular node
    kubectl describe node <name-of-first-node> 
    ```

    **or**
    ```bash
    # once you become more familar with jsonpath, you could do the same like this
    kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}' | kubectl describe node
    ```

    **or if you prefer to use tools like `jq`**
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o json | jq '.items[0].metadata.name' | kubectl describe node
    ```

## Bonus

1. Take a quick look at `kuberenetes` cheatsheet. It's useful and will come in handy when diving deeper into `kubectl`.

    * [Kubernetes Cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/)

 > **_Skip below two tasks for now if you are new to bash / linux command line_**

2. Setup an alias for `kubectl`

    * In `bash`, you can setup aliases, so that you don't have to type `kubectl` everytime and just use the shorthand.

        * For e.g. it's common to configure `k` for `kubectl`

    * This can be done by adding `alias k=kubectl` to your `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

        ```bash    
        # open .bashrc from your home directory using your editor of choice. 
        code ~/.bashrc

        # Go to end of the file and add the alias
        alias k=kubectl

        # Save and exit the editor
        # ctrl + s or file menu -> save
        ```  

    * Restart the shell or run a `source` from the terminal.

        ```bash
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

2. Enable kubectl `autocompletion` for bash (or zsh)   

    Enable auto completion for your kubectl to improve the CLI experience.
