# AKS cluster creation

For a simple cluster creation on personal / MSDN subscription using CLI, see [01_create_your_own_aks_cluster_and_acr.md](https://github.com/suren-m/cw/blob/master/labs/04_aks_cluster/01_create_your_own_aks_cluster_and_acr.md)

---
### Below is for Terraform based approach.

#### Note: The `aks.tf` example here uses `user-assigned managed Identity` for control plane that is also configured to get `network contributor` access to subnet. ([BYO Control Plane feature](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-kubernetes-service-aks-now-supports-bringyourown-control-plane-managed-identity/))

#### If you had created the cluster via portal and had used `system-assigned managed identity`, then you'd need to ensure that it has access to the subnet in order to create `internal` services or `ingress controllers` on internal network
```
# az aks show -n <clustername> -g <rgname> --query=identity (or identityProfile for kubeletIdentity)
# az role assignment list --assignee <Id> --all -o table
# az role assignment create --assignee $ASSIGNEE --role 'Network Contributor' --scope $SUBNETID ($VNETID for wider scope)

# Make sure the SP executing this template has access for role assignment (owner on that RG)
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "assignment" {
  principal_id         = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.aks.identity[0].principal_id
  role_definition_name = "Network Contributor"  
 
  # Increase the scope to VNET or RG level Only if subnet-level is insufficient (likewise for NSG)
  scope                = azurerm_subnet.aks.id
}

# Check with az and jq
# az aks show -n cndev -g azenv-uks --query=identity | jq '.principalId' | xargs az role assignment list --all -o table --assignee
```


### Have a look at `aks.tf` to get a better understanding of additional configuration items for AKS.


`aks.tf` will create the following resources

Once the cluster is created, you may need to use `-a` flag with `az aks get-credentials` to access it as a `cluster-admin`. 

```
Terraform will perform the following actions:
