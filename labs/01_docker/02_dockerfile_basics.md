# Docker File

## Create your first Dockerfile and execute a `CMD` (greeter:1.0)

1. From `docker` directory, create a sub-directory called `my_first_dockerfile` and create a `Dockerfile` inside it.

> You can do `touch Dockerfile` from the terminal or just right-click on the folder you want to create the file under and select `New File`

    ```bash
        # from my_first_dockerfile directory
        touch Dockerfile
    ```    
    
### Your setup should look like this.
    
    ```bash
    ├── cw_labs
        ├── docker
        │   └── my_first_dockerfile
        │       └── Dockerfile
        └── kubernetes
    ```

3. Type the below inside the `Dockerfile`. (Avoid copy pasting unless specified)

    ```bash
    FROM ubuntu 
    # Base Layer

    CMD ["echo", "Hello everyone"]

    ```

4. Build your Docker Image. Make sure the terminal is pointing to the directory where `Dockerfile` is located.    

    ```bash
        # Build an image called `greeter` and tag it as version `1.0`
        docker build . -t greeter:1.0
    ```

    > Important: Take your time to understand what `-t` does. And also note the `.` after docker build. 

5. See your new docker image by `docker images`

6. Launch a container from the new docker image.

    ```bash
        docker run greeter:1.0

        # Observe the output
    ```

7. Make it print something else by overriding the default CMD

    ```bash
        docker run greeter:1.0 echo "hello universe"
        #or any command of your choice that is available in ubuntu image
        docker run greeter:1.0 sleep "3"
    ```
    Notice that we have to specify the full command to override the existing one.

## Use `Entrypoint` to make greeter a bit more configurable.

1. Update the `Dockerfile` as below. Comment out previously written code if needed.

    ```bash
        FROM ubuntu

        ENTRYPOINT [ "echo" ]

        CMD ["Hello everyone"]
    ```

2. `Build` and tag greeter image with version 2.0 and `Run` the container.

    ```bash
        docker build . -t greeter:2.0 
        docker run greeter:2.0
    ```
3. Now just run the below to make the container print message of your choice.

    ```bash
        docker run greeter:2.0 "Hello Greeter 2.0"
    ```

## Use `COPY` to launch a simple static website

1. Create a new `Dockerfile` in another folder or feel free to continue working on your existing `Dockerfile`. 

2. Create a folder called `website` and create a file inside called `index.html`. Type some simple markup such as below.

    Note that filenames in linux are case sensitive. 

    ```html
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    ```

3. Now, type the below into your `Dockerfile`

    ```bash
        FROM nginx:alpine 
        # Notice the change in base image. 
        COPY ./website/ /usr/share/nginx/html
        # Copy the contents of website folder into nginx default website location
    ```

>Nginx is a powerful and highly popular webserver. See Nginx base image here: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx

5. Now Build your docker image as below: (feel free to pick your own name for the image)

    Make sure your folder structure should look something like below before building.

    ```bash
    .
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── website
        └── index.html
    ```

    ```bash
        docker build . -t hello-web:1.0
        docker images "hello-web" # to see your new built image. 
    ```

5. Run the image detached and do port-forwarding. You will get an exception if the port is already in use.

    ```bash
        docker run --name my-first-website -d -p 9000:80 hello-web:1.0
        # Notice the `--name` argument. We give our own container name this time.
    ```

6. Ensure the container is running as expected with `docker ps`. Observe all the columns of your `my-first-website` container.

7. Stop the container using `docker stop <container-name>`
